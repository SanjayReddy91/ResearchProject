# 7th Semester Research Project
Code for Research Project regarding solving jigsaw puzzles using Machine Learning

Used Genetic Algorithm to solve Jigsaw puzzles with square puzzle pieces of varying sizes and complexities.

# Instructions
1. Use the Testing.ipynb file to test the code.
2. Alternatively you can view all the modules and functions used in the genetic algorithm in the genetic.py file from mypackage directory.
3. Any necessary modules can be added directly to the genetic.py file and then easily imported to work with using Testing.ipynb.
